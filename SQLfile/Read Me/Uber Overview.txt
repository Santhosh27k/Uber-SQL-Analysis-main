
# 🚖 Uber Trip Data Analysis using SQL Server

A data-driven exploration of Uber trip records designed to uncover key operational insights through SQL-based querying and preprocessing.  
This project walks through structured phases—from data cleaning and anomaly detection to zone-based trip patterns and time-based behaviors—laying a solid foundation for further visualization and reporting using Power BI.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates how structured SQL queries can be used to:

- Clean raw trip data and validate its integrity
- Detect and isolate anomalies using logical thresholds
- Analyze trip behavior by time of day, day of week, and location
- Extract meaningful trends like busiest zones and peak hours
- Prepare for visualization using Power BI

> ✅ All queries are executed in **Microsoft SQL Server**, and results are documented in the `.sql` file.
